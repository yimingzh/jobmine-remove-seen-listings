# Remove Listings You Have Already Read on Jobmine!
Takes Jobmine listings as spreadsheets and removes ones you've already looked over. 

How to use: 
1. When you are ready to browse jobmine, go to jobmine and export the listings into an excel sheet. 
2. Copy it over to a Google Drive Spreadsheet
3. That's basically going to serve as a record of what job listings you have already "seen". If you don't plan to go through all of the listing, delete some of the rows from the spreadsheet as well. 
4. Name that sheet "Old" 
5. When you go back to jobmine, and there's more jobs to look at, export another excel file (do not change the excel files in any way)
6. Copy it to your Google Drive and name a new sheet "New" with the new information
7. Copy and Paste the code in this repository into "Tools -> Script Editor" 
8. Run the script from the script editor. 
9. Tada!
